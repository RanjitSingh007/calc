# With Main Method
1. Only the first run of month input does check for a valid month number, after that, subsequent prompting does not check for month number. For example, given this input combination:
12
1
1
1
2018
13
14
Would return a date range when 13 and 14 was supposed to be invalid months. However, if the following combination was given:
13
1
14
1
Then the system would say the months are invalid and assuming to be 1 (Janurary)

2. The month of February allows inputted date to be up to 31 when it should have max 29 (for leap year) or 28 (for normal years)

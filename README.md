# With Main Method
1. Only the first run of month input does check for a valid month number, after that, subsequent prompting does not check for month number. For example, given this input combination:
12
1
1
1
2018
13
14
Would return a date range when 13 and 14 was supposed to be invalid months. However, if the following combination was given:
13
1
14
1
Then the system would say the months are invalid and assuming to be 1 (Janurary)

2. The month of February allows inputted date to be up to 31 when it should have max 29 (for leap year) or 28 (for normal years)

# With Calc
1. The calc() method does not account for a wrong date in any months. Putting in a day which exceeds the day cap for that months will cause it to calculate the in between days based on the inputted date (Ex: input 31 for April or 30 for February will cause the calculation to be based on the inputted date, not capped date). **This was not found by the test case**. If given this input:<br>
<code>int days = Cal.cal(1,31,2,31,2017)</code><br>
should give days as 28 days or invalid input, but instead gives 31 days.
2. The fault is created after removing "=" sign from the <code>for</code> loop of <code>cal()</code>. This will cause incorrect calculation of number of days. <code>calSixMonthsTest()</code> <code>calLeapYearTest()</code>, and <code>calYearTest()</code> test cases will reach this fault and fails. Therefore, these three test cases will find this fault.


# Test Case Description
1. Our Test Set checks many different conditions that could arise in real world scenarios. For example, we check the normal conditions or the “happy paths” giving different tests for different intervals of time such as, months having 31 days which is what the <code>calMonthThirtyOneDaysTest()</code> method checks for, those having just 30 days which is what is being tested by the <code>calMonthThirtyDaysTest()</code>, and evening going on to test two months and six months using the <code>calMonthSixtyDaysTest()</code> and <code>calSixMonthsTest()</code> respectively. The Test Set also checks the month of February since we need to ensure the program calculates leap years properly using the <code>calFebLeapYearTest()</code> and <code>calFebNotLeapYearTest()</code>. We also perform a test that checks random dates that fall within the parameters of the applications “happy path”. The final test we perform is to ensure that a integer is entered, this is being tested in all the parameters that may be passed into <code>cal()</code>. All of this is also well documented in the <code>CalTester.java</code> file with brief descriptions as well as a possible test value range for some of the conditions.
